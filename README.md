# VSA Journey

In this repository, I will be building a simple project to master VSA (Vertical Slice Architecture) as well as CQRS pattern together witth Mediator Pattern using MediatR.

I've read several articles, watched several videos about the vertical slice architecture so I thought why not build a project around it. This will be a simple but elegant projectt.

I plan to explore and cut through several parts of building robust APIs In ASP.Net that I haven't covered before. They include

1. Robust Authorization (RBAC) Role Based Access Control. Microsoft Identity or JWT
2. Structured Logging with Serilog. I recently learned this.
3. Middlewares. Plugging MediatR in validation pipelines 
4. Background Jobs. Hangfire and Redis. Might explore RabbitMQ later.
5. Mailing service.
6. Unit Testing and IE testing with Xunit
7. API Docs with Swagger
8. I might also play with S3 for file uploads.
9. Docker for containarization and deployment. Might also explore Github actions.
10. If I reach this point, I will do my best to deploy on Azure. I tried it before, I was a noob then, it should be easier now.


I know it wouldn't be easy but I will achieve this. Once I can get this, I will continue to focusing on architectural patterns, DSA and best practises in building enterprise softwares.
